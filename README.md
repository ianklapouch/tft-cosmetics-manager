# TFT Cosmetics Manager

A project developed in .NET using WPF, which allows you to create profiles based on your TFT cosmetics and then quickly switch between them by selecting them or use the random function which selects random cosmetics among the ones you have.

This project uses [LCU](https://hextechdocs.dev/getting-started-with-the-lcu-api/) to read the cosmetics you have and select them in the client and [CDragon](https://www.communitydragon.org/) to handle the images.

# Setup
Download win-x64 (64-bit OS) or win-x86 (32-bit OS) from [Releases](https://github.com/ianklapouch/tft-cosmetics-manager/releases) and run the executable.

Available for Windows only.

# How to use
## Creating a profile
- On the home screen select **ADD ITEM**
- In the create profile screen, give your profile a name at the top and select a Little Legend, Arena, Boom and click **SAVE** or **CANCEL** if you want to cancel the profile creation
- After creating your profile, it will be added to the list of profiles on the home page and you just have to click on the profile in the list and it will be selected in your client

## Deleting a profile
- After creating a profile you can delete it by clicking on the button with the trash can icon in the right corner of each profile

## Setting random cosmetics
- On the main screen select the **RANDOMIZE** button to set a random combination of Little Legend, Arena and Boom in you client

## Conclusion
This is an open source project developed just for the purpose of studying the tool, creating a portfolio and bringing something I would like to have to the community
